# LeadBox
Kiana Beauty specific Lead Box based off of Eager.io Lead Box

__Lead Box__ was originally developed by the team at Eager, specifically [Adam Schwartz](https://github.com/adamschwartz).

View the original project [here](https://github.com/EagerIO/LeadBox)

This version of Lead Box is a fork, deisgned to be used on our website [Kiana Beauty](http://www.kianabeauty.com.au). The out-of-the-box method provided by Eager relied on FormTree, whilst we desired to integrate with [Mautic](http://mautic.org) for Marketing Automation purposes.
